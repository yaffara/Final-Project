# Final-Project
This is for the Sal 603 Final project that will include a presentation. It will most likely be based around football data and next gen stats. Im excited to figure it out, but I know it will take me a while to create something special which is going to be the goal of this project
This is the idea I took. I used 2024 nfl team data and created a tell based on the given data from link to data https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2024/ to create three visuals
